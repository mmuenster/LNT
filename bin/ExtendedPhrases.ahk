As with any standardized test, there are some limitations.  The major limitation is the potential for error in HPV typing because of probe cross-hybridization and relatively low sensitivity.  Additionally, if the viral DNA is low, there might not be detection. Finally, the probe only detects specific HPV types, so there might be infections caused by other strains of the virus not detected by this method.
